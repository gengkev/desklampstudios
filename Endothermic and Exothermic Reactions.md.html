<h1>﻿Science: Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions</h1>

<h2>What are they?</h2>

<p><strong><em>Endo</em>thermic reactions</strong> are chemical reactions in which more energy is absorbed than produced, so that the temperature <em>decreases</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exo</em>thermic reactions</strong> are chemical reactions in which more energy is produced than absorbed, so that the temperature <em>increases</em>.</p>

<p>The reactions have the opposite effects of each other. In fact, in many cases, you can almost perfectly reverse one reaction by using a reaction of the other type.</p>

<p>The meanings of the words can be easily identified by looking at their roots. The Greek root <em>endo</em> means "in", and the root <em>exo</em> means "out". The suffix <em>thermic</em> refers to thermal energy, or heat. In the same way, in an endothermic reaction, heat energy goes <em>in</em>, while in an exothermic reaction, heat energy goes <em>out</em>. This can be useful when trying to memorize the difference between the two.</p>

<p>Another way to memorize each is by memorizing two other words you already know. You can think of <em>endo</em> as "<em>en</em>door" (indoor), and you can think of <em>exo</em> as "<em>exo</em>plosion" (explosion).</p>

<h2>Storing Energy</h2>

<p>The heat energy that goes into an endothermic reaction becomes stored in the chemical bonds in the resulting products. The stored energy can then be released by an exothermic reaction. Different forms of energy can also be absorbed or released. For example, photosynthesis uses light energy, while cellular respiration gives off chemical energy in the form of ATP.</p>

<h2>What’s the point?</h2>

<p>You may not realize it at this point (no pun intended), but endothermic and exothermic reactions are all around us. Heat packs that you might shake generate heat because you are mixing the two chemicals inside of them together. These chemicals create an exothermic reaction when mixed, which is why you can feel the heat.</p>

<p>In an ice pack (ones that you break apart), you usually have to snap the pack in half. This is because it opens up another hole inside of the pack and as a result, it allows the two different chemicals to mix again.</p>

<h2>Graphs</h2>

<p>Graphing the change of temperature over time can help you determine which reactions are endothermic and exothermic.</p>

<p>{{drawing}}</p>

<p>In endothermic reactions, temperature has a negative correlation with time, and in exothermic reactions, temperature has a positive correlation with time. The slope of the graphs also play a role: the steeper the slope, the faster the reaction takes place.</p>

<h2>Processes vs. Reactions</h2>

<p>You probably already know the three most common states of matter: solids, liquids, and gases. The changes in state between them are, in fact, physical changes. As such, you might be tempted to give water boiling, for example, as an example of an exothermic reaction.</p>

<p>However, this is an exothermic <strong>process</strong>, not an exothermic reaction. It's important to remember the difference between reactions and other processes. Processes are more general, and include changes in states of matter.
Endo/exothermic <em>reactions</em> are chemical reactions, hence their names. Chemical reactions occur when the atoms in the reactants rearrange to form different substances. Boiling doesn’t change the chemical composition - the steam that is created still consists of water molecules.</p>
